In this lab, we practice reading data from a PDF file and extract information from strings.

Here is [a reference](https://blog.datazar.com/extracting-pdf-text-with-r-and-creating-tidy-data-f399011549cc) that you could follow.

The pdf file ["gisaid_id_table.pdf"](./gisaid_id_table.pdf) has information about COVID_19 sequences that contain certain mutations.

The task is to extract all of the Accesssion IDs from the pdf file.

In the end, output a text file as "EPI_ids.txt" that contains all the accession ids.

Good luck!

```{r}
writeLines(readLines("EPI_ids.txt", 10))
```
